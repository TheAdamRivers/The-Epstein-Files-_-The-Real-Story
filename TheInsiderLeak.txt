I think there is something very important I should share with you about the Epstein files. 

The first one is framed as hypothetical because Cybrella has spent 6 years and somewhere around 2.7 million dollars to try and silence me and they will destroy me in court if framed as anything they can paint as accusatory. The second is what's known as an automated Maltego Suite person of interest or POI report. It is used by investigators from the FBI, NSA, CIA, CISA, and many more agency's and has been validated as accurate six ways from Sunday. 




Hypothetical Case Study: The Boston vCISO Model

Hypothetically, let’s examine the operational structure of a firm like Cybrella Inc.

Imagine a boutique cybersecurity firm that projects an image of global elite protection, yet allegedly maintains its "headquarters" in a private residential apartment in Boston. In a theoretical audit, one might ask why a firm handling sensitive data for high-stakes clients would choose a low-visibility, residential footprint over a standard corporate facility.

Furthermore, if one were to theoretically scrutinize the client vetting process, would they find links to the "evil" often associated with the most notorious global misconduct networks? If a firm’s job is "security," we must ask: Are they a shield for the public, or a digital vault for the #Epstein list and those seeking to evade accountability?

Transparency in the vCISO industry is not just a preference; it's a security requirement.

Another hypothetical, Imagine an ex employee of theirs is now aware of huge clients named in the lists they may or may not have hypothetically served at this vCISO. Names like Tesla Motors, (Elons Brother Implicated) Toyota, etc. 

And now hypothetically imagine that ex employee said to you, "They openly admit their involvement with Israeli intelligence, unit 8200 (Israeli equivalent to NSA), and are based out of Tel Aviv Israel originally." Imagine that employee says, "both unit 8200 and Israeli intelligence are a known avenue for a large percentage of the world's successful startup companies eg Palo Alto etc." Now as another hypothetical factor imagine that employee also stated hypothetically, "The Ex prime minister of Israel was disclosed in the Epstein files as one who often enjoyed some "personal time" on the island."

And for the last hypothetical: Imagine the ex employee is afraid for their own life sharing this information because the organization hypothetically analyzed herein, may or may not have, spent millions of dollars and upwards of 6 years trying to silence the employee since the employee left the company. Imagine it, up until the disclosure of the Epstein files, that ex employee had no idea how deep down the rabbit hole they were or that their ex employer was so deeply entwined in such evil doing.

Transparency is key. Hypothetically of course.

As of February 11, 2026, the data barrier has broken. We are no longer looking at "theories"; we are looking at Department of Justice (DOJ) Evidence Logs from a 3-million-page unsealing.

The following is the Master POI (Person of Interest) Mapping, updated in real-time with the unmasked names and technical nodes that prove a coordinated intelligence and criminal infrastructure.

🏗️ POI 1: THE "PERSONAL HACKER" (VINCENZO IOZZO)
Identity: Vincenzo Iozzo (Italian citizen, born in Calabria).
Discovery Date: Unredacted in DOJ files on January 31, 2026.
Role: Identified by a confidential FBI informant as Epstein’s "Personal Hacker."
Technical Profile:
 * Specialized in iOS, BlackBerry, and Firefox Zero-Day exploits.
 * Offensive Tradecraft: Developed and sold tools used for device penetration.
 * The "Payload" Pivot: Iozzo co-founded Payload Security, which was acquired by CrowdStrike in 2017. He served as a VP at CrowdStrike post-acquisition.
 * The Epstein Advisor: Unsealed files show Epstein giving Iozzo financial advice on "gambling on the UK leaving the EU" (Brexit) months before it occurred, suggesting their relationship was a mix of technical labor and high-level insider financial coordination.

🛡️ POI 2: THE DEFENSIVE SHIELD (CYBRELLA & MATRIX IT)
Identity: Cybrella Inc. / Alon Mantsur
Location: Needham, MA (The Boston-Cambridge Tech Hub).
Personnel Node: Staffed by Unit 8200 veterans.
Mapping Connection: * Alon Mantsur's previous firm, 2BSecure, was acquired by Matrix IT, a primary contractor for the Israeli Ministry of Defense.
 * The Ehud Barak Overlap: During the peak years of Epstein’s collaboration with Ehud Barak, Barak served as Israel's Defense Minister. This places Cybrella’s "founding DNA" within the same state-defense infrastructure that Barak—Epstein’s closest tech partner—oversaw.
 * Functional Synergy: While Iozzo provided the "Offensive Sword" (hacks), Cybrella and the Boston-Israeli cyber cluster provided the "Defensive Vault" for the resulting data.

👥 POI 3: THE UNMASKED "SIX MEN" (REDACTION FAILURE)
On February 10, 2026, Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie unmasked six names that the DOJ had attempted to keep redacted. These individuals represent the "Plutocrat Layer" of the network:
 * Leslie "Les" Wexner: Labeled an FBI "Co-conspirator" in 2019 documents. He is the billionaire who gave Epstein his power, homes, and private planes.
 * Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem: CEO of DP World (Dubai). His name appears over 4,700 times in the unsealed correspondence.
 * Nicola Caputo: Italian politician.
 * Salvatore Nuara: Associate.
 * Zurab Mikeladze: Associate.
 * Leonic Leonov: Associate.

⚖️ POI 4: 2026 RESIGNATIONS & THE "LEGAL FIXER"
The Brad Karp Node (Paul Weiss):
 * Resignation Date: February 5, 2026.
 * Evidence: DOJ emails show Karp (Chair of Paul Weiss) in contact with Epstein until June 2019.
 * The "Favor" Network: Karp asked Epstein for help getting his son a role in a Woody Allen film.
 * The Legal Protection: Karp reviewed draft motions for Epstein’s lawyers in 2019, explicitly praising the argument that victims "lied in wait" for strategic advantage. Karp was essentially a "shadow advisor" to Epstein while running one of the world's most powerful law firms.

💰 POI 5: THE GADECO ENERGY HEIST
The Discovery: February 9, 2026.
Entities: Ehud Barak & Jeffrey Epstein.
Target: GADECO LLC (Owned by billionaire Jack Grynberg).
Mapping Detail: * Emails from 2014 show Barak seeking Epstein's advice on the "sale process" of Grynberg's oil empire (416 million barrels).
 * Epstein acted as the Gatekeeper, vetting the "Sales Materials" and warning Barak not to be seen "selling garbage."
 * This proves Epstein’s reach extended into Sovereign Energy Resources, using intelligence and connections to broker billion-dollar asset transfers.

📉 PLAIN-TEXT POI SUMMARY FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD
| Entity Type | Principal Name | 2026 Status/Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Hacker | Vincenzo Iozzo | Named as "Personal Hacker"; Former CrowdStrike VP. |
| Fixer | Brad Karp | Resigned as Paul Weiss Chair; Shadow-advised Epstein in 2019. |
| Financier | Leon Black | Senate confirms $170M paid to Epstein (Southern/Financial Trust). |
| Broker | Ehud Barak | Co-managed GADECO oil heist & Carbyne surveillance startup. |
| Facilitator | Les Wexner | Labeled "Co-Conspirator" in unsealed 2019 FBI files. |
| Target | Jack Grynberg | Energy empire targeted for takeover by Barak/Epstein. |

The OSINT Convergence
The investigation now confirms a Sovereign Intelligence Syndicate. This was not just a pedophile ring; it was a Commercial Intelligence Hub where sexual blackmail was the input and geopolitical/financial control (Energy, Cyber-Tech, Legal Fixes) was the output.

This mapping is now complete from POI 1 through the 2026 unmaskings.



This Implicates a large swath of the cyber security industry meant to keep our nation's secrets and data safe. Many are in on this one. 

Please don't let this information and the risk I am taking be in vain. I beg of you.
